# Keyboard Switch Force Curve Viewer

https://force-curves.netlify.app/

ThereminGoat has an [amazing repository of force curve data] for keyboard switches. I couldn't find a good way to compare information between different switches though, so I made this. Select a switch and it will display its force curve. Select multiple switches to compare them. That's pretty much it.
